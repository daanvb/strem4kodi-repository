# Strem4Kodi

**Your Stremio library, built for the Kodi remote.**

Strem4Kodi is daanvb’s independent Kodi addon: a cinematic browsing interface, clearer source selection and configurable playback, using your Stremio account and installed addons. Kodi handles video playback; Strem4Kodi supplies its own browsing interface and an optional companion player skin.

**Latest published version: 1.8.59.** [Install and update](https://daanvb.github.io/strem4kodi-repository/) · [Full changelog](changelog.txt)

## What's new in 1.8.59

- Close the loading card when the current video starts, with a fallback for missed callbacks.
- Prevent dismissed loading cards and duplicate busy artwork from covering playback.
- Fetch cited title-specific production trivia in the background from Wikimedia, with source attribution, caching and an offline fallback.
- All **1,173 automated tests passed**. Native device transitions still need confirmation.

Includes player skin **0.1.17**. Restart Kodi after updating both packages. Ten-second trivia rotation and the two-second resume grace are retained.

## Install and configure

Requires **Kodi 21 or later**. Install the repository ZIP, then install Strem4Kodi from **Program add-ons**. The required player skin installs automatically. Restart Kodi after updating both packages.
