# Strem4Kodi

**Your Stremio library, built for the Kodi remote.**

Strem4Kodi is daanvb’s independent Kodi addon: a cinematic browsing interface, clearer source selection and configurable playback, using your Stremio account and installed addons. Kodi handles video playback; Strem4Kodi supplies its own browsing interface and an optional companion player skin.

**Latest published version: 1.8.56.** [Install and update](https://daanvb.github.io/strem4kodi-repository/) · [Full changelog](changelog.txt)

## What's new in 1.8.56

- Fix the persistent white progress line in the runtime-generated poster and wide cards used by Home, Discover, Favourites and Watch Later.
- Share aligned dark tracks and themed fills between card builders, and automatically regenerate cached layouts after updates.
- Check the final generated layouts in both focus states across all five themes. Previous checks inspected the templates that the builders replaced.
- All **1,131 automated tests passed**. The faster playback handoff from 1.8.55 is retained; the latest supplied device report measured **7.69 seconds total**, including **0.90 seconds preparation**.

Player skin remains **0.1.16**. Restart Kodi after updating. Ten-second loading trivia and the two-second resume grace are retained. Poster rendering still needs confirmation on the user's device.

## Install and configure

Requires **Kodi 21 or later**. Install the repository ZIP, then install Strem4Kodi from **Program add-ons**. The required player skin installs automatically. Restart Kodi after updating both packages.
